# Collections

The `pkg/collections` package contains multiple interfaces for collections, modelled after the Java Collections Framework. The only actual implementation currently contained is a `LinkedList`, which fulfills the `List` and `Queue` interfaces.

The package also contains further packages that contain some auxiliary functions for working with slices and maps in golang, e.g. for filtering.
